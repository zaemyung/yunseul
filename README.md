# Yunseul (윤슬)

> *Yunseul (윤슬)* — Korean for *sparkling ripples on the water*. Where your notes catch the light: brilliant insights amidst a chaotic web of notes.

Chat with your Obsidian vault using a local OpenAI-compatible LLM server (LM Studio, Ollama, llama.cpp server, vLLM, LocalAI) or the Claude Code CLI.

</p>

**Status:** Pre-1.0 — actively developed; expect breaking changes between versions.

## What it does

- **Two backends, your choice.** Connect to a local LLM server (LM Studio, Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, LocalAI) for fully-offline chat, or ride your existing Claude Code subscription via the `claude` CLI subprocess.
- **Vault-aware retrieval.** Optional on-device BM25 search pulls the most relevant notes for every question. A "Top retrieved sources" block under each reply shows what the model saw, with clickable wikilinks back to the originals.
- **Tied to your current note.** Each session binds to the active file, so Append always lands where you started — even if you switch notes mid-conversation.
- **Streaming everything.** Tokens appear as they're generated; Stop anytime; multi-turn conversations persist locally per session.
- **Provider-aware diagnostics.** "Test connection" and the offline banner tell you *exactly* what went wrong (no model loaded, CORS off, `claude` not on PATH, etc.) and how to fix it.
- **Safe by default.** Sanitized streaming render, sanitized writes to disk, injection-guarded vault excerpts, secret-redacted debug output. External images and unsafe URL schemes in assistant output never silently fetch.
- **Operator's Console aesthetic.** Bubble-less, typographically driven, theme-aware. Plays well with Catppuccin, Things, Minimal, and stock Obsidian.

## Providers

Yunseul ships two backends. The active one is selected under Settings → Yunseul → Provider.

### LM Studio (and other OpenAI-compatible local servers)

Talks to any server that implements the OpenAI `/chat/completions` SSE protocol — LM Studio, Ollama, llama.cpp server, vLLM, LocalAI. Configure the base URL, API key (if your server requires one), and the model id in Settings → Yunseul. Everything runs on your machine: prompts, vault excerpts, and retrieved chunks never leave the host.

### Claude Code subprocess

Spawns the local `claude` CLI binary. Yunseul does NOT manage an API key for this provider; it rides on your existing Claude Code authentication (Pro/Max OAuth, Anthropic Console, Bedrock, Vertex, etc.) as configured in your Claude Code install. Configure the binary path (optional — defaults to `claude` on `PATH`) and model in Settings → Yunseul → Provider: Claude Code subprocess. Writes (Edit/Write tools) are off by default; toggle "Allow writes" to let the assistant modify vault files.

## Privacy & data flow

- **LM Studio path:** prompts, vault excerpts, and retrieved chunks stay on your machine. No network calls leave the host beyond the local server URL you configured.
- **Claude Code path:** prompts, vault excerpts, and retrieved chunks are sent to Anthropic via your authenticated `claude` CLI. See Anthropic's privacy policy: https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy
- **BM25 index** stays in your vault at `<vault>/.yunseul/bm25-index.json`. It is never uploaded by Yunseul itself; any sync service watching the vault will see it (see "Sync services" below).
- **Sessions** persist locally at `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/yunseul/sessions/<id>.json`.
- **Environment variables are allowlist-filtered, not collected.** The Claude Code subprocess inherits only a minimal allowlist (`PATH`, locale, proxy vars, and `CLAUDE_*`/`ANTHROPIC_*`/`AWS_*`/`GOOGLE_*`/`VERTEX_*` auth vars the CLI needs); everything else — including all `ELECTRON_*` internals — is stripped. Yunseul never reads hostname, username, or hardware identifiers, and no environment data leaves your machine.
- **Clipboard is write-only and user-initiated.** The Copy buttons write chat text to the clipboard; Yunseul never reads from it.
- **API keys** for the LM Studio provider are stored in plain text in `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/yunseul/data.json` (Obsidian's standard plugin data location).
- **No telemetry, no analytics, no automatic network calls** without an explicit user action (sending a message, clicking Test Connection, or building the vault index).
- **Persisted assistant output is sanitized.** When Append or Download writes assistant text to a vault note, external images, `data:` URIs, Obsidian `![[embed]]` syntax, and unsafe link schemes are rewritten as bracketed placeholder text (e.g., `[blocked external image: host]`, `[blocked data image]`, `[embed stripped: target]`). This applies to both Append-to-note and Download-as-Markdown paths, is independent of the in-chat "Allow external images" toggle, and cannot currently be disabled.

## Installation

### Community plugin store (recommended, when published)

1. Open **Settings → Community plugins** in Obsidian.
2. Turn **Restricted mode** off.
3. Click **Browse**, search for "Yunseul", and install.
4. Enable Yunseul.

### Manual install

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the latest [release](https://github.com/zaemyung/yunseul/releases).
2. Create a folder at `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/yunseul/` and drop the three files into it.
3. In Obsidian: **Settings → Community plugins → Restricted mode OFF → Yunseul**.

## Vault search & the on-disk index

When the "Enable vault search" toggle is on, Yunseul builds a BM25 inverted index over every markdown file in your vault. The index lives at:

```
<vault>/.yunseul/bm25-index.json
```

Notes on this file:

- It is stored as a single JSON document under the vault root (NOT inside `.obsidian/`) so it survives plugin reinstall.
- Size scales roughly with the total token count of the indexed bodies. A vault of 5,000 notes typically produces a 30-150 MB index; a vault of 50,000 notes can produce a multi-hundred-MB index.
- The file is rewritten atomically (`*.tmp` sibling + rename) whenever an indexed note changes. The debounce window is 1.5 seconds.

### Sync services

The index file lives under the vault root, so anything that watches the vault will see and potentially sync it. To exclude it:

- **Obsidian Sync:** Obsidian Sync ignores hidden files (paths starting with `.`) by default, which covers `.yunseul/`. Verify in your sync settings.
- **iCloud (macOS):** Append `.nosync` to the directory to opt out: rename `.yunseul` to `.yunseul.nosync`. Note this requires updating the path in the plugin code.
- **Syncthing:** Add `.yunseul/` to the folder's `.stignore` file.
- **Dropbox / OneDrive / Google Drive:** Most desktop clients do not provide per-folder ignore lists; consider moving your vault out of the synced folder if you don't want a multi-hundred-MB index uploaded.
- **git:** Add `.yunseul/` to your vault's `.gitignore`.

### Resetting the index

To remove the on-disk index, either:

- Open Settings → Yunseul → Vault search → Reset index, or
- Run the command "Reset vault index" from the command palette.

Both routes show a confirmation modal before deleting the file.

## Contributing & building from source

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for dev setup, code conventions, architecture overview, and how to add a provider or setting.

## Support the work

Yunseul is built with care, in spare hours, by one person — alongside other small things that try to make a few minutes of someone's day a little brighter. If it's been useful to you, a coffee keeps the next small bright thing alive.
